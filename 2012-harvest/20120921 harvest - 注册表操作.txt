	The key that the RegCreateKeyEx function creates has no values. An application can use the RegSetValue or RegSetValueEx function to set key values. 
	The key identified by the hKey parameter must have been opened with KEY_CREATE_SUB_KEY access. To open the key, use the RegCreateKeyEx or RegOpenKeyEx function. 
	An application cannot create a key under HKEY_USERS or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. 
	An application can use RegCreateKeyEx to temporarily lock a portion of the registry. When the locking process creates a new key, it receives the disposition value REG_CREATED_NEW_KEY, indicating that it "owns" the lock. Another process attempting to create the same key receives the disposition value REG_OPENED_EXISTING_KEY, indicating that another process already owns the lock.
